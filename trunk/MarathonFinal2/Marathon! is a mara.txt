Marathon!" is a software that provides profiles of runners and stimulation environments for a user to use. Each option is accessible from a simple main menu. 

The simulation runs by a button that the user presses on the top of the window. The runner outcomes are randomized. The user can run as many simulations as the user wants. 

The marathon profile has no interface for the user to switch profiles; the program does it on its own, via a timeline.
